Escape the Winter
=================
A small premature game that [cmdsoniq][] and [i][] build on the Berlin Mini Game Jam
on 22.11.2014.

Graphics: [cmdsoniq][]  
Code: by [i][]

The Aim is to escape from the winter that cames from the left side. Try to
collect humans on you way. If you have lost to many humans on you way, you will
die. If you have to many humas in your group then the winter will catch you...

The game is not ready yet and some features are missing.
